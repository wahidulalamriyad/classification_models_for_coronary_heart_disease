# Classification_Models_For_Coronary_Heart_Disease
Conducted research and developed a system under Dr Jixin Ma on the comparison of numerous classification models to predict coronary heart disease using past medical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Executed the project using tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, and evaluated the classification models beyond accuracy using ROC Curve and AUC Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
Achievement - Implemented supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest to conduct the research and achieved an accuracy of 89% by hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
